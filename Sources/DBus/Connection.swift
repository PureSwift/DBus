///
/// - **read** means to fill the incoming message queue by reading from the socket.
/// - **write** means to drain the outgoing queue by writing to the socket.

///
/// The method `readWriteDispatch()` for example does all three of these things, offering a simple alternative to a main loop.

/// In an application with a main loop, the read/write/dispatch operations are usually separate.
